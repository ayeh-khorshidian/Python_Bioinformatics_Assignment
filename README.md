# Python Bioinformatics Assignment I

This repository contains solutions for basic Python programming tasks focused on bioinformatics applications, including printing to the console, working with variables, and manipulating DNA sequences.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Installing Python
Guidelines for installing Python based on operating system:
- **Windows**: [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows)
- **Mac**: [Python for macOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx)

### Task 2: Hello World Program
A basic program that prints "Hello World" to the screen.

### Task 3: Variables and Calculation
A program that stores the integers 62 and 99 in variables, adds them, and displays the result.

### Task 4: Personal Information Display
A program that declares and displays personal information, such as name, age, and desired annual income, in a formatted string.

### Task 5: DNA Sequence Manipulation
A program that:
1. Accepts a DNA sequence as user input.
2. Prints the length of the sequence.
3. Counts the occurrences of 'A' in the sequence.
4. Converts the DNA sequence to RNA by replacing 'T' with 'U'.

## Usage

1. Run each task by executing `tasks.py` in a Python environment.
2. Follow prompts for Task 5 to input a DNA sequence and see the output manipulations.
